- Redis

### Installation Steps

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/monokpe/alx-project-nexus.git
    cd alx-project-nexus
    ```

2.  **Create a virtual environment:**
    ```bash
    python -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows, use `venv\Scripts\activate`
    ```

3.  **Install dependencies:**
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

4.  **Set up environment variables:**
    Create a `.env` file in the root directory and add the following:
    ```
    DEBUG=True
    SECRET_KEY='your-secret-key'
    DATABASE_URL='your-database-url'
    REDIS_URL='your-redis-url'
    ```

5.  **Run database migrations:**
    ```bash
    python manage.py migrate
    ```

### Verification

To verify the installation, run the development server:
```bash
python manage.py runserver
```
You should see output indicating that the server is running.

---

## Quick Start Guide

1.  **Create a superuser:**
    ```bash
    python manage.py createsuperuser
    ```

2.  **Run the development server:**
    ```bash
    python manage.py runserver
    ```

3.  **Access the API:**
    The API will be available at `http://127.0.0.1:8000/`. You can use a tool like `curl` or Postman to interact with the endpoints.

### Expected Output

When you run the server, you should see something like this:
```
Watching for file changes with StatReloader
Performing system checks...

System check identified no issues (0 silenced).
September 19, 2025 - 10:00:00
Django version 5.0, using settings 'nexus.settings'
Starting development server at http://127.0.0.1:8000/
Quit the server with CTRL-BREAK.
```

## Usage Documentation

This project is a Django REST API. You can interact with it using any HTTP client.

### API Documentation

For detailed information about the API endpoints, please refer to the [API Reference](#api-reference) section.

### Common Use Patterns

- **Fetching a list of products:**
  ```bash
  curl http://127.0.0.1:8000/api/products/
  ```
- **Creating a new user:**
  ```bash
  curl -X POST http://127.0.0.1:8000/api/users/ \
    -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
    -d '{"username": "testuser", "password": "testpassword"}'
  ```

## Development Setup

### Developer Installation

Follow the same steps as the [Installation Guide](#installation-guide).

### Running Tests

To run the test suite, use the following command:
```bash
python manage.py test
```

### Code Style

This project follows the [PEP 8](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/) style guide. We use `black` and `flake8` for code formatting and linting.

### Pre-commit Hooks

<!-- TODO: Add instructions for setting up pre-commit hooks -->

---

## API Reference

<!-- TODO: Add detailed API endpoint documentation -->

### Endpoints

- `/api/users/`: User management
- `/api/products/`: Product management

### Authentication

This API uses JSON Web Tokens (JWT) for authentication. To access protected endpoints, you need to include an `Authorization` header with a valid token.

### Error Codes

- `400 Bad Request`: The request was invalid.
- `401 Unauthorized`: Authentication credentials were not provided.
- `403 Forbidden`: You do not have permission to perform this action.
- `404 Not Found`: The requested resource was not found.

---

## Configuration

### Environment Variables

- `DEBUG`: Set to `True` for development, `False` for production.
- `SECRET_KEY`: A secret key for a particular Django installation.
- `DATABASE_URL`: The URL of the PostgreSQL database.
- `REDIS_URL`: The URL of the Redis server.

### Security Considerations

- **Do not** run in debug mode in production.
- **Do not** expose the `SECRET_KEY` in version control.
